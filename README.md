  Work Allocation
  
  Due to the nature of the project, the different levels of coding knowledge of group members, and the fact that all group members were very busy on internships, not much time could be allocated to collaborating and discussing on the project. Hence, we decided that we would work on the project in our own time according to our own abilities, instead of allocating specific portions to each person.
